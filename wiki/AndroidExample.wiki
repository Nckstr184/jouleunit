#summary An Android example that can be used together with the JouleUnitWorkbench for the Eclipse IDE.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

This example shows how to energy profile an Android hello world application by using JouleUnit and the JouleUnitWorkbench. We assume that you installed the JouleUnitWorkbench already. Otherwise check the respective [http://code.google.com/p/jouleunit/wiki/JouleUnitWorkbench wiki page] for further details.

  * Please also note that you installed all plugins necessary for the Android extensions of the JouleUnit Workbench as mentioned on the respective [http://code.google.com/p/jouleunit/wiki/JouleUnitWorkbench wiki page].

== Example Sources ==
This example consists of two Eclispe projects, located within the JouleUnit SVN. Please load the following projects from the SVN (https://jouleunit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/workbench/examples/android) and import them into your Eclipse workspace:

  * helloworld
  * helloworldtest

Afterwards, the _Project Explorer_ should look as follows:

http://jouleunit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/projectexplorer.png

The first project, _helloworld_ contains an example Android application simply displaying a _Hello World_ message once started on an Android device. If you are new to Android development, you can run the tutorial available at http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html to get further information about Android applications and how to run them on mobile devices.

The second project _helloworldtest_ contains a simple JUnit test suite consisting of one test case. The JUnit test suite is contained in the _src_ directory and called _org.jouleunit.helloworld.test.HelloWorldTest_. If you want to learn more about JUnit testing of Android, please have a look at http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_eclipse.html

If you open the test suite, it should look as follows:

http://jouleunit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/helloworldtest.png

  * TODO Explain test cases. The test case TODO will open the hello world application and will simply wait for ten seconds.

  * To run the test suite as a normal JUnit test, select _TODO_ in the context menu. Afterwards, the test suite should be deployed on your Android device and being executed.
