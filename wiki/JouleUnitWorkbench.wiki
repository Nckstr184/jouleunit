#summary Overview on how to use the Eclipse-based JouleUnit workbench.

= Introduction =
The JouleUnit workbench is Eclipse-based additional tooling for the JouleUnit framework, especially for the visualization of JouleUnit profiling and testing results.

This documentation explains how to install and use the JouleUnit workbench and the provided examples.

== Installation ==
To run the JouleUnit Workbench, Eclipse is required. If you do not have an Eclipse instance ready to use yet, download Eclipse from http://eclipse.org/
We recommend to use the Modeling Tools Edition, but feel free to use another Eclipse version instead.

=== Running the JouleUnit Workbench from the SVN ===
Currently, not JouleUnit Update site exist, yet. Therefore, you have to check out the JouleUnit plugins from the SVN and run them in a Runtime Eclipse instance or to build your own deployable plugin JARs for your Eclipse instance.

To check out the JouleUnit plugins you will require an SVN client, e.g., Subversive (http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/).
