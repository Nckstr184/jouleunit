= JouleUnit Nao Example =
This page documents a small JouleUnit example to profile and test an application developed for Nao humanoid robots.

The example is documented in a paper that is currently in a conference submission process. Thus, further details will be public available later (probably in January 2012).

The source code of the example can be found here http://code.google.com/p/jouleunit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fexamples%2Forg.qualitune.jouleunit.example.nao
